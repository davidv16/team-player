# Tempo Frontend Assignment

## Installing

npm install

## Running

Start the project using:
npm start

and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Build and test

To build the project you can run the following commands.

- npm run build
- npm run lint
- npm run test

## Solution

The application is set up with a navigation bar where one can switch between teams and users.

Each page displays a list of teams or users.

Each item in the list is clickable transferring one to a detailed page of the item.

State management was done with mobx and the application was written in React with Typescript.

User Interface was done with semantic-ui-react. I wanted to use the @temposoftware/tuik but it wasn't available on npm.js

I didn't have much time to solve the assignment so the Unit testings had to be postponed.
